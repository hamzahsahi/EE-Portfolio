# Signal Analysis Using MATLAB (Signals & Systems I)

## Overview
This project consists of selected Signals and Systems labs implemented
using MATLAB, focusing on time-domain and frequency-domain analysis of
signals and linear systems.

The work emphasizes practical use of MATLAB for signal representation,
Fourier analysis, and communication-related signal processing rather
than purely theoretical derivations.

## Topics Covered
The project includes two main components:

### Time-Domain Signal Analysis
- Definition and manipulation of continuous-time and discrete-time signals
- Visualization of signals using MATLAB plotting tools
- Understanding signal behavior through time shifting and scaling

### Frequency-Domain and Communication Signal Analysis
- Fourier Series representation of periodic signals
- Fourier Transform analysis of non-periodic signals
- Amplitude modulation of signals
- Spectral analysis of modulated signals
- Examination of magnitude and phase spectra
- Interpretation of signal behavior in the frequency domain

## MATLAB Implementation
- MATLAB scripts were written to generate and visualize signals
- Fourier Series coefficients were computed and analyzed
- Fourier Transform analysis was used to study signal spectra
- Modulated signals were generated and analyzed in the frequency domain
- Emphasis was placed on correct scaling, clear plots, and interpretation
  of results

## Tools Used
- Software: MATLAB
- Techniques: Signal plotting, Fourier Series, Fourier Transform,
  modulation, frequency-domain analysis
