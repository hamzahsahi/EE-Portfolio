# 8-bit CPU and ALU Design Using VHDL

## Overview
This project involved the design and simulation of a simple 8-bit central
processing unit (CPU) using VHDL. The system was built by combining both
combinational and sequential logic components and was simulated using
Quartus.

The CPU includes an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), registers, a finite state
machine (FSM), and a 4-to-16 decoder. The design was completed as part of
COE 328 – Digital Systems.

## System Architecture
The CPU is composed of the following main components:
- **Registers (Latches):** Store two 8-bit input values (A and B)
- **ALU:** Performs arithmetic and logical operations on inputs A and B
- **FSM (Control Unit):** Cycles through states and controls ALU operation order
- **4:16 Decoder:** Converts FSM output into microcode for ALU operation selection
- **Seven-Segment Display:** Displays ALU output results in hexadecimal format

All components were integrated into a single system-level design.

## ALU Functionality
The ALU operates on two 8-bit inputs and performs operations based on a
16-bit microcode input generated by the control unit. Implemented operations
include:
- Addition and subtraction
- Bitwise logic operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
- Bit shifting and rotation
- Comparison operations (min/max)
- Bit manipulation functions

The ALU produces an 8-bit result along with a negative flag, and the result
is displayed using two 7-segment displays.

## Control Unit
The control unit consists of:
- A **finite state machine (FSM)** that cycles through defined states
- A **4-to-16 decoder** that converts FSM state outputs into ALU microcode

The FSM ensures the CPU components operate in the correct sequence and
controls which ALU operation is executed at each state.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Hardware Description Language:** VHDL
- **Simulation Software:** Intel Quartus
- **Design Method:** Block diagram design with component-level VHDL modules

## Validation
- Functional simulation was performed in Quartus
- Waveforms were used to verify correct register operation, ALU outputs,
  FSM state transitions, and decoder behavior
- Results were confirmed against expected truth tables and microcode tables

## Documentation
The full design process, component descriptions, VHDL code, block diagrams,
and simulation waveforms are documented in the final lab report:
