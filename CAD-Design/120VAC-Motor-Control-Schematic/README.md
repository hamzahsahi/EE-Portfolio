# 120 VAC Motor Control Schematic (AutoCAD)

## Overview
This project involved creating a 120 VAC motor control schematic using
AutoCAD. The schematic represents a basic control circuit that allows a
motor to be started and stopped using momentary push buttons and a
contactor with auxiliary holding contacts.

The focus of this project was correct schematic layout, component
representation, and clear control logic rather than physical wiring.

## Circuit Description
The motor control circuit consists of:
- **Circuit Breaker (CB1):** Provides overcurrent protection
- **Start Push Button (S1 – Normally Open):** Energizes the control circuit
- **Stop Push Button (S0 – Normally Closed):** Interrupts control power
- **Contactor Coil (K1):** Controls motor operation
- **Auxiliary Contact (K1 – NO):** Provides a holding (seal-in) circuit
- **120 VAC Control Supply:** Line (L) and Neutral (N)

When the START button is pressed, the contactor coil is energized and the
auxiliary contact closes to maintain the circuit. Pressing the STOP button
opens the control circuit and de-energizes the contactor.

## Tools Used
- **CAD Software:** AutoCAD
- **Voltage Level:** 120 VAC control circuit

## Design Considerations
- Clear labeling of components and contacts
- Proper representation of normally open (NO) and normally closed (NC)
  devices
- Logical left-to-right control flow
- Separation of control elements and power references

## Documentation
The complete schematic drawing is included as a PDF:

## What I Learned
- Creating readable and structured electrical schematics
- Representing control logic using standard electrical symbols
- Translating control concepts into formal schematic drawings
- Using AutoCAD for electrical drafting and documentation
