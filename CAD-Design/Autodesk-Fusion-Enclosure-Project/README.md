# Electronics Enclosure Design (Autodesk Fusion)

## Overview
This project involved designing a compact electronics enclosure using
Fusion. The enclosure was created to house internal electronic
components while providing mounting features and an external USB port
cutout.

The focus of this project was practical 3D CAD modeling, enclosure
layout, and consideration of assembly and manufacturing constraints.

## Design Features
- Rectangular enclosure with removable top cover
- External USB port cutout for connectivity
- Internal mounting plate for securing electronics
- Mounting holes for component attachment
- Filleted edges for improved appearance and handling
- Compact form factor suitable for small electronic systems

## Design Considerations
- Clearance for internal components and connectors
- Alignment between enclosure base and cover
- Structural wall thickness for durability
- Ease of assembly and component access
- Simple geometry suitable for basic manufacturing or 3D printing

## Tools Used
- **CAD Software:** Autodesk Fusion 
- **Modeling Techniques:** Sketching, extrusion, fillets, parametric modeling

## Renders
The following rendered views are included:
- Exterior view showing enclosure shape and USB cutout
- Interior view showing mounting plate and internal layout

## What I Learned
- Creating parametric 3D models in Fusion 
- Designing enclosures with internal mounting features
- Accounting for connectors and user access in mechanical designs
- Translating functional requirements into a physical enclosure model
